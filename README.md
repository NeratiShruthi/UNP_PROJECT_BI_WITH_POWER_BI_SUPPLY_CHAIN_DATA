# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA
I did this project in collaboration with UNP, This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for supply chain data analysis, providing key insights into various aspects of operations. The dashboard will visualize critical metrics, including revenue by product type, sales vs. availability, stock levels, and total sales by SKU. It will also track shipping costs by transportation mode and carrier, average shipping times, and total lead times by product type. Additionally, the analysis will cover supplier performance, defect rates, production volume by inspection results, and a cost breakdown. By integrating these data points, the dashboard will enhance decision-making, optimize logistics, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.
